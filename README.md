# FT-817 CAT library

This is a CAT library to interface with a Yaesu FT-817 radio, with a lot of STAMINA via direct EEPROM access...

## Inspiration

- [James Buck, VE3BUX FT-857D library](http://www.ve3bux.com)
- [KA7OEI FT-817 pages](http://www.ka7oei.com/ft817pg.shtml)
- [Andy Webster FT-817_Buddy project](https://github.com/g7uhn/ft817_buddy)

## Goal

This sketch is handled in PlatformIO, and it's goal is to test the core of a future lib, look in the `lib` folder...

## WARNING!

This code is a moving target, as I'm adding a lot of features and fixing bugs, I will work on the main branch util declared stable.
